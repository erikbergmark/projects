## College Enrollment Predictions
Predicting college enrollment rate for Chicago Public Schools (CPS) high schools. Linear regression model found using R, utilized leaps package for variable selection and weighted least squares to treat heteroscedasticity. Findings displayed in a report, including exploratory data analysis to enhance understanding of the data.

## Loan Status Classification
Used logistic regression to determine whether applicants are eligible for a loan or not based on given socio-economic statistics. Used SAS to create relevant visualizations and tables to understand the data, as well as the model. Final model selected using stepwise selection. Findings displayed in a report with tables and visualizations. 

## Data Wrangling Shiny App
Used tidyverse and shiny libraries in R to create a shiny app. The app allows for users to input a custom CSV url. The app will load the CSV and display the full dataset. The user has options to transform the dataset, including column selection, row filtering, and NA removal. Changes made to the data are displayed live in the app, including relevant information such as dataset dimensions and column data types. The app allows the user to download the cleaned and transformed dataset as a CSV for continued use. Designed to streamline the data wrangling and cleaning aspects of the data science pipeline.
