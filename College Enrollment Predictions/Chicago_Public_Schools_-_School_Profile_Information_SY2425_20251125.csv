Clemente scholars grow, learn and excel in their students while developing social and emotional skills that will last them a lifetime.  
 Opened in 2012, Clemente serves approximately 490 students from kindergarten to eighth grade. Clemente prides itself on a rigorous curriculum, an individualized approach to learning, and strong parent partnerships.  A tradition of excellence is the cornerstone of Clemente, which is driven by the commitment of families and the community. 
 While rigorous academics are a top priority at Clemente, we also know that social-emotional development and personal growth are important to the overall education of our Lion student body. Our students start each day with a healthy breakfast and social-emotional learning to feed their bodies and minds. After school, there are extensive clubs, activities and sports that involve nearly the entire school. 
 Clemente’s inspiring teachers, staff, and administrators believe the greatest service we can provide our students is an education that equips them with the intellectual, emotional and social skills necessary to succeed in their post-elementary life. 
 Clemente is part of the Acero Schools network. At Acero Schools, our mission is transforming minds through academic empowerment and success. We provide a strong academic foundation for students at the elementary level to help them master the fundamental skills necessary for success in high school and beyond.","Director","Bridget Harris","Assistant Principal","Vanessa Frye","2050 N NATCHEZ AVE","Chicago","Illinois","60707","3124555425","3124555456","https://www.cps.edu/schools/schoolprofiles/400120","http://rc.aceroschools.org","https://www.facebook.com/Clementeaceroschools","https://twitter.com/aceroschools","https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmfIQzdtWyRnJ0PDwYIfc7w",,"true","K,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8","K-8","462","365","68","216","44","411","5","0","0","0","0","0","2","0","There are 462 students enrolled at ACERO - CLEMENTE.  79% are Low Income Students.  14.7% are Diverse Learners.  46.8% are Limited English Learners.","The largest demographic at ACERO - CLEMENTE is Hispanic.

Little Black Pearl Art & Design Academy has the capacity to serve up to 150 students in grades 9-12 with rigorous academic programming and emphasis in visual arts, technology, music, dance, graphic and architecture design.  
 
LBPA continues to find ways to build relationships with our students and bridge that gap both internally and externally. One of the very successful activities that occur in school is the use of Restorative Justice practices as a first layer of interaction with behavior challenges that occur with students. In addition, the staff has developed external relationships with organizations in the community and throughout the city. These relationships are providing internship opportunities and employment skills training.","Director",,"Acting Principal","Dr. Donald Pittman","1060 E 47TH ST","Chicago","Illinois","60653","7736905500","7732851633","https://www.cps.edu/schools/schoolprofiles/400137","https://www.lbpacademy.org","https://www.facebook.com/LBPADA","https://twitter.com/LBPAADA",,,"false","9,10,11,12","9-12","1","0","0","0","1","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0",,"The largest demographic at LITTLE BLACK PEARL HS is Black.

This year, our students have performed at Ravinia and the University of Chicago (as a part of Cantare Chicago). They have also travelled to County Line Orchard, Northerly Island, Iron Oaks and White Pines Ranch for outdoor education. Additionally, we take advantage of the many opportunities available in Chicago, such as the Brookfield zoo, Field Museum, Sky Deck at Willis Tower, 826 Chi, Chicago Fire, Chicago Wolves, and Chicago Sky. 
 
In addition to our phenomenal academic program, PCA also boasts an extensive after school program that includes drumline, soccer, poetry, hip-hop dance, Indian dance, K-2 dance, radio broadcasting, photography, cooking with Common Threads, gardening, and basketball.","Principal","Yadira Bernadac","Assistant Principal","Taylor Adams","1420 W 17TH ST","Chicago","Illinois","60608","7735347675","7735347797","https://www.cps.edu/schools/schoolprofiles/610013","https://pilsenacademy.org",,"https://twitter.com/PilsenAcademy",,,"true","PK,K,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8","PK,K-8","217","173","42","134","23","190","2","0","2","0","0","0","0","0","There are 217 students enrolled at PILSEN.  79.7% are Low Income Students.  19.4% are Diverse Learners.  61.8% are Limited English Learners.","The largest demographic at PILSEN is Hispanic.

grade students at Josephine C. Locke Elementary School, located at 2828 North
Oak Park Avenue, Chicago, Illinois 60634, to Charles P. Steinmetz College Prep,
located at 3030 North Mobile Avenue, Chicago, Illinois 60634.


During a comprehensive replacement of Locke’s
roof, the structural engineer overseeing the renovation identified extensive
concrete deterioration following the removal of the masonry. The concrete
deterioration is structurally significant and potentially compromises the
capacity of the beam that supports the mansard roof framing of the second floor
classrooms of the west side of the school. The structural engineer determined
that relocating the west side second floor classrooms is appropriate and in the
best interest of student safety.

On September 11, 2019, upon notification from
the structural engineer that the west side second floor classrooms would need
to be evacuated, Locke administration relocated students to alternate locations
within the school on a temporary basis.

To ensure the continued safety of students and
staff, starting Monday, September 16, 2019, all 7th and 8th grade students will
move to an interim facility, Steinmetz College Prep, which is less than one
mile from Locke Elementary School. It is expected that 7th and 8th grade
students will return to Locke on January 6, 2020.  More information
regarding this emergency relocation is detailed in the notice letter to parents
and guardians of students.

The district is unable to comply with applicable
requirements pursuant to 105 ILCS 5/34-200 through 5/34-235 due to the
unexpected nature of this incident and imminent safety concerns. It further
imposes restrictive timelines that would impede the school’s ability to
immediately address safety concerns.","Principal","John Gerard Fitzpatrick","Principal","John Fitzpatrick","2828 N OAK PARK AVE","Chicago","Illinois","60634","7735343300","7735343168","https://www.cps.edu/schools/schoolprofiles/610041","https://lockeschool.org",,,,,"true","PK,K,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8","PK,K-8","1,091","813","210","453","36","876","151","12","1","5","0","9","1","0","There are 1091 students enrolled at LOCKE J.  74.5% are Low Income Students.  19.2% are Diverse Learners.  41.5% are Limited English Learners.","The largest demographic at LOCKE J is Hispanic.
